# Zillow-Price-Prediction

### 1. DESCRIPTION

This project aims to build a novel regression algorithms based on
an open-source housing price dataset provided by Zillow.
In this project, our team will develop a complete pipeline for
data preprocessing, descriptive analysis, visualization, feature engineering, and modeling.
We will provide a detailed description of our approach in the final report,
and also a coding demo for how to develop the pipeline from scratch.

### 2. INSTALLATION

A large proportion of this project(preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling) is written in python(jupyter notebook).

Here you should use python 3.6.x or higher version to execute the code.

Following packages are required for implementing our codes:

jupyter<br>
numpy<br>
pandas<br>
matplotlib<br>
seaborn<br>
warnings<br>
time<br>
sklearn<br>
IPython<br>
tensorflow<br>
xgboost<br>
vecstack<br>

### 3. EXECUTION

3.1 Download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1/data<br>
3.2 data pre-processing and feature engieering by open jupyter notebook: Preprocessing<br>
3.3 Fitting the model by open jupyter notebook: baseline_model_improved<br>

For the visualization:
cd final_visualization  
python3 server.py
open your browser and go to "http://localhost:8000"
